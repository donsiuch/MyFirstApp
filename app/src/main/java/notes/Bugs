Creating tasks:
- (Done) Each next task created over rides the previous Alarm Manager registration. Need to give unique
information to PendingIntent.getBroadcast

Deleting tasks
- (Done) When deleting tasks the screen never refreshes
- (Done) Cannot delete more then 1 task at a time without restarting the application.
- When marking a task for deletion, any other task can be deleted. This is most likely due to
the delete member field as part of the list view and not the child. Add a new field to
cusomt_list_view_row.xml

Task:
-Taskid data member is of type int, however type long corresponds to the rows of the database.
Further, must pass an a unique integer to getBroadcast() when creating a new intent. If I change the
taskId to long then I cannot use the taskId any longer.

Cleanup:
- Move the setAlaram() function to AlarmManager class
